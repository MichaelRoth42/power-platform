# Administer Power BI

Power BI administrators use the Power BI admin portal to manage a Power BI tenant, including the configuration of governance policies, usage monitoring, and provisioning of licenses, capacities, and organizational resources. Power BI admin content is available at [What is Power BI administration?](/power-bi/service-admin-administering-power-bi-in-your-organization)

> [!NOTE]
> Though you administer Power BI from the [Power BI admin portal](https://app.powerbi.com/), you request support for Power BI through [Help + Support](get-help-support.md) in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
