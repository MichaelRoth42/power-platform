# Administer Power Apps

Features from the Power Apps admin center have moved to the Microsoft Power Platform admin center. Power Apps administrators can use the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) to manage environments and settings for Power Apps.

See [Administer Microsoft Power Platform](admin-documentation.md).
