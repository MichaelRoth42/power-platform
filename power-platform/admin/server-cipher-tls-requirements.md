# Server cipher suites and TLS requirements

A [cipher suite](/windows/win32/secauthn/cipher-suites-in-schannel) is a set of cryptographic algorithms. This is used to encrypt messages between clients/servers and other servers.  

Before a secure connection is established, the protocol and cipher are negotiated between server and client based on availability on both sides. 

You can use your on-premises/local servers to integrate with the following Dataverse services:
1. Syncing emails from your Exchange server.
2. Running Outbound plug-ins.
3. Running native/local clients to access your Dataverse environments.

To comply with our security policy for a secure connection, your server must have the following: 

1. Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 compliance

2. At least one of the following ciphers: 

   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Older TLS 1.0 & 1.1 and cipher suites, (for example TLS_RSA) have been deprecated; see the [announcement](../important-changes-coming.md#tls-rsa-cipher-suites-are-deprecated).
   > 
   > Your servers must have the above security protocol to continue running the Dataverse services.

   You may either upgrade the [Windows version](/windows/win32/secauthn/cipher-suites-in-schannel) or update the [Windows TLS registry](/windows-server/security/tls/tls-registry-settings) to make sure that your server endpoint supports one of these ciphers.

   To verify that your server complies with the security protocol, you can perform a test using a TLS cipher and scanner tool:
   1. Test your hostname using [SSLLABS](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html), or
   2. Scan your server using [NMAP](https://nmap.org/)

3. The following Root CA Certificates installed:

   |Common name of the CA  |Thumbprint (SHA1)  |
   |---------|---------|
   |[DigiCert Global Root G2](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalRootG2.crt)     | df3c24f9bfd666761b268073fe06d1cc8d4f82a4        |
   |[DigiCert Global Root CA](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt)     | a8985d3a65e5e5c4b2d7d66d40c6dd2fb19c5436        |
   |[Baltimore CyberTrust Root](https://cacerts.digicert.com/BaltimoreCyberTrustRoot.crt)     | d4de20d05e66fc53fe1a50882c78db2852cae474        |

   **Why is this need?**

   See [TLS 1.2 Standards Documentation - Section 7.4.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.2) - certificate-list.
