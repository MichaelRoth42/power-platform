# Use variables

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]

> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](authoring-variables.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](teams/authoring-variables-teams.md)

Save customers' responses in a bot conversation to variables and reuse them later in the conversation.

For example, save a customer's name in a variable called `UserName` and the bot can address the customer by name as the conversation continues. Or, use variables to create logical expressions that dynamically route the customer down different conversation paths. You can also feed variables to [Power Automate](advanced-flow.md) and [Bot Framework skills](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-skills-overview?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true) as input parameters, and save the output results from those actions.  

## Prerequisites

## Entity and variable type

Power Virtual Agents uses [entities](advanced-entities-slot-filling.md) to identify a specific type of information from a user's responses. A variable type is associated with the identified information when it's saved. The variable type is analogous with the entity.

Each entity or variable type maps to a base type, as listed in the following table. The base type determines the operators that you can use when you construct a logical expression with the corresponding variable. It also determines whether you can feed a variable to a [flow](advanced-flow.md) or [Bot Framework skill](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-skills-overview?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true) as an input parameter.

For example, a **boolean** base type maps to an operator "is equal to" with possible values being True or False. A **number** base type gives you numeric operators such as "is equal to," "is greater than," or "is greater than or equal to," and so on.

## Create a variable

In the bot authoring canvas, add a question node. A variable is created automatically in the node.

1. Go to your bot's [**Topics page**](./authoring-create-edit-topics.md) and open the topic you want to add a variable to.

1. Select the plus (**+**) icon, and then select **Ask a question**.

    A variable that contains the user's response is automatically created.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/Automatically_created_variable_(draft).PNG" alt-text="Create a variable.":::

## Pick an entity to use

By default, a question node is created with multiple-choice options. To use a different prebuilt or custom entity, choose what to identify from the node.

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/Pick_an_entity_(draft).PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting an entity.":::

## Rename a variable

Automatically created variables come with a default name. To rename a variable, select the variable name, enter a new name, and select **Done**.

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/Rename_a_variable_(draft).PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of renaming a variable.":::

## Use variables in action nodes

When you use a variable in an action node, if its base type matches a parameter type that's specified for a flow or Bot Framework skill, you can feed it to that parameter. The output from action nodes generates new variables.  

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/User_a_variable_in_Skills(draft).PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of using an entity in an action node.":::

## Use literal values in action nodes

You can type a literal value into the variable input field in an action node instead of selecting a variable from the menu.

## Passing variables between topics

When you redirect to other topics, you can pass values into variables in the destination topic or get variables back from it. Passing variables between topics is especially useful when you already have information that the topic needs. Your users will appreciate not having to answer the question again. It's also helpful when you refactor and separate your topics into reusable components and you want to pass variables across the topics.

> [!NOTE]
> Variables of type `Custom Entity`, `Date Time`, and `Duration` can't be passed between topics.  

### Receive values from other topics

When a topic defines a variable (for example, by a question node), the bot asks the user the question to fill in the variableâ€™s value. If the bot has already acquired the value, there's no reason to ask the question again. In these cases, you can define the variable as **Receive values from other topics**. When another topic redirects to this one, it can pass a variable (or [literal values](#using-literal-values-on-variable-inputs)) into this variable and skip the question. The experience for the user talking to the bot is seamless.

To receive values from other topics, set the variable's property:

1. In the **Question** node, select the variable that you want to receive values from other topics.

1. In the **Variables properties** pane,  under **Topic (limited scope)** select **Receive values from other topics**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-properties-receive-input.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing the Variable properties pane with Receive values from other topics selected.":::

1. Save the topic.

1. Go to a topic that you want to redirect to. Follow the steps in [Redirect to another topic](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#redirect-to-another-topic) to redirect to the correct topic.

1. Select **+ Add input for destination topic**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-step1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing adding input for the destination topic.":::
<!-- Please correct the misspelled "Restautant" in this screenshot and any others that show the same topic. :) -->

1. Select a variable in the redirected topic that you want to pass the variable to.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-step2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing selecting the variable in the redirected topic.":::

1. Under **Enter or select a value**, select the variable in the current topic that you want to pass to the redirected topic.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-step3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing selecting the variable from the list of options.":::

    The variable is shown in the redirected node.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-step4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing the variable being passed into the redirected node.":::

### Return values to original topics

When a topic asks a question, or obtains a variable from an action in some other way, the variable can be returned to the original topic that redirected to it.

In this case, the variable also becomes part of the original topic and can be used like any other variable. This helps you construct the topic so that information the bot obtains is available across topics, reducing the need for global variables.

To return a variable to the original topic, set the variable's property:

1. In the **Question** node, select the variable that you want to receive values from other topics.

1. In the **Variables properties** pane, under **Topic (limited scope)** select **Return values to original topics**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-properties-return-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing the Variable properties pane with Return values to original topic selected.":::

1. Save the topic.

1. Go to a topic that you want to redirect to. Follow the steps in [Redirect to another topic](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#redirect-to-another-topic) to redirect to the correct topic.

    The variable that's being returned to the topic is shown in the redirected topic. Use the returned variable in your topic.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-pass-receive.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing a redirected topic with both values input and returned.":::

### Using the Variables pane

Use the **Variables** pane to select the receive or return status of multiple variables at once.

1. On the topic's menu bar, select **Variables**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-variables-bar.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing the Variables pane icon.":::

1. For each of the variables in the topic, select whether you want the values to be passed, received, or both between topics.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-variable-return-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing the Variable pane with two variables and a combination of input and output selected.":::

### Using literal values on variable inputs

You can pass literal values as well as variables to a topic. To pass a literal value, type the value you want to use as the input instead of selecting a variable.
